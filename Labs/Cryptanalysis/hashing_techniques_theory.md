\## 1. MD5 (Message Digest 5)

\*\*Overview:\*\*  

MD5 is a widely-used cryptographic hash function that converts input data of any length into a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. The output is always represented as a 32-digit hexadecimal number.  

\*\*Use Cases:\*\*  

\- Verifying data integrity  

\- Password storage (legacy systems, not recommended for modern security)



---



\## 2. SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

\*\*Overview:\*\*  

SHA1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, usually rendered as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. It was widely used for digital signatures and certificate verification.  

\*\*Use Cases:\*\*  

\- Digital signatures  

\- Message authentication codes (MACs)  

\- File integrity verification
